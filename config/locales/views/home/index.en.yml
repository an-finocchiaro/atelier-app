      atelier_text: "Atelier Cité is the stage for the colorful history of three artists: Émile Tuchband, Isabelle Tuchband and Verena Matzen. Émile was born in Paris and lived between Brazil and France, where he held several exhibitions at the Marcel Bernheim Gallery. Isabelle, Émile's daughter, grew up among the brushes and colors of her father's atelier in Brazil. Verena was born in Argentina and moved to Brazil as a child. Isabelle and Verena lived together in Paris, where they studied at the École des Arts Décoratifs. In 1989, they opened the Atelier Cité on Rua Bela Cintra, in São Paulo. Although each artist has developed their individual language, the fundamentality of color connects the set of works and has been the soul of the curatorship of several exhibitions, such as the one held by MAB-FAAP, TUCHBAND & TUCHBAND. A shared stage bursting with color, spirituality and joie de vivre. Bienvenue a tous!"
