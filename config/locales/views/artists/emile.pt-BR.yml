He arrived in Brazil at the age of twenty-three, having already graduated in his hometown, where he attended the School of Fine Arts and the School of Architecture. Among his artistic activities in France, the fact of having helped Marc Chagall in the elaboration of the ceiling of the Paris Opera stands out. In Brazil, he settled for a long period in the city of Taubaté. Throughout his career, he exhibited his work in several exhibitions.
