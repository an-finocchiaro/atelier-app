      verena_minibio: "Verena Matzen was born in 1965 in Buenos Aires, the daughter of Jorge and Edda Matzen. The Matzen family moved to Brazil in 1972 and settled in São Paulo, where Verena later studied Fine Arts at Faculdade Santa Marcelina. In 1988, the artist moved to Paris where she studied at the École des Arts Décoratifs and at the Louvre Museum. He lived in Berlin for two years (2000-2002), where he participated in several group exhibitions. Verena Matzen's art transits between the construction of delicate and detailed mythical scenarios and a language where the lines no longer contain the energetic representations of the cosmos, galaxies or floating caramels. He participated in several national and international exhibitions and developed several artistic projects, including a public work in the São Paulo subway. Lives and works in São Paulo, Brazil."
