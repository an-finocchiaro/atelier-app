      verena_minibio: "Verena Matzen was born in 1965 in Buenos Aires, the daughter of Jorge Matzen and Edda Kappuhn. The Matzen family moved to Brazil in 1972 and settled in São Paulo, where Verena later studied Arts at Faculdade Santa Marcelina. In 1988, the artist moved to Paris where she studied at the École des Arts Décoratifs and at the Louvre Museum. She lived for two years in Berlin, where she held the individual exhibition 'The Creation of the World'. She participated in several national and international exhibitions - such as at the Museum of Image and Sound in São Paulo, the MAR Museum in Rio de Janeiro, the Musée de L'Homme, the Musée de la Poste and the Galerie Zygmund Bislansky in Paris, in addition to exhibitions in Madrid and Beirut - and developed several artistic projects, including a public art work at the Santa Cruz subway station in São Paulo. Her first book, 'Verena Matzen, the Meeting Ceremony', was released in 2016 with an exhibition at the museum MIS in São Paulo. Her art toggle between the construction of delicate and meticulous mythical scenarios and a universe where the lines can no longer confine the energetic representations of the cosmos, galaxies or abstract worlds. Lives and works in São Paulo, Brazil."
