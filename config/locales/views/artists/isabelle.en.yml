      isabelle_minibio: "Born in 1968 in a small town in the countryside of Brazil - Taubaté, Isabelle Tuchband is daughter of the french artist Émile Tuchband and the tennis player Marlene Tuchband. Her experience with art started early living among the colors in her father's studio. As a teenager she began her artistic career studying sculpture with José Demétrio, a renowned brazilian sculptor. Later, she studied art at Faculdade Santa Marcelina in São Paulo, at the École des Arts Décoratifs and at the Louvre Museum in Paris. Authentic and free, Isabelle has a very personal language that translates and represents the contemporary intensity in paintings and collages that overflow with energy, colors and movement. She participated in several national and international exhibitions and developed several artistic projects, including a public art work at Santa Cruz subway station in São Paulo. Lives and works in São Paulo, Brazil."
