Her experience with art started early living among the colors in her father's studio. She started her career as a teenager studying sculpture and painting in porcelain and ceramics. Later, she studied Art at Faculdade Santa Marcelina in São Paulo, the École des Arts Décoratifs and the Louvre Museum in Paris. She participated in several national and international exhibitions - at the FAAP Museum of Brazilian Art and at the Jewish Culture Center in São Paulo, at the Musée de L'Homme, the Musée des Arts Décoratifs and the Galerie Landrot in Paris, in addition to exhibitions in Beirut, Lisbon, Madrid and New York - and developed several artistic projects, including a public art work at Santa Cruz station in São Paulo subway.
